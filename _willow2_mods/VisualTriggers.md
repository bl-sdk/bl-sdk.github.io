Provides keybinds for outlining waypoints and triggers with skeleton debug cylinders.
![Visual Triggers](https://github.com/GameChanger97/Bl2-Mods/blob/main/Borderlands%202%20(32-bit,%20DX9)%209_15_2021%204_17_58%20PM%20(2).png?raw=true) 
By default '8' will toggle waypoints and '9' will toggle triggers. 
Once enabled, you can change the keybinds for showing triggers and waypoints in the keybinds menu. 
 
There is also an option in the mod menu: 
* The number of lines slider allows you to set the number of line segments you want the debug cylinders to draw with from 6 to 50. 
* Note that the more lines, the more accurate the outline will be to the true hitbox so higher settings is recommended.
