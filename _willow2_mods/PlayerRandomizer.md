Fills a player's trees with random skills, and
updates class mods to boost skills from the new set.

Idea stolen from Abahbob's Cross Class Skill Randomizer.

# Usage:
From the main menu, under Mods, enable 'Player
Randomizer (New Seed)'.  Bring up Options-&gt;Mods-&gt;Player
Randomizer to control how you want to randomize your
character.
  - **Skill Sources** sets which characters to pull skills
from.
  - **Additional Skills** lets you include skills that
should work despite referencing the wrong Action Skill,
as well as skills that may be nonfunctional or badly
broken.
  - **Action Skill** determines which character's action
skill to assign to yours; note that graphics may be
wrong for some character/skill combinations, but the
effects should still work correctly.  Exception:  Krieg's
Buzzaxe Rampage does not work for other characters.
  - **Skill Density** selects how much to fill in the skill
tree - for reference, BL2 character trees are about 60%
full, while TPS trees average 65% full.
  - **Randomize Tier Points** changes how many skill
points it takes to unlock the next skill tier.
  - **Randomize COMs** enables modifying the player's
classmods to contain skills from the new random tree.
  - **Cheats** lets one specify particular skills that
should definitely appear in the character's skill tree.
  - **Reroll** chooses a new set of skills for the
character.

Once you've made your choices, load your character and
start the session as usual.  Changes to settings in the
in-game menu will have no effect until after a return to
the main menu.
