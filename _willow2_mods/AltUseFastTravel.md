 This mod enables alt use for fast travel stations that will travel you to either your current objective, the station you last traveled from, or a specific station.


Current objective will take you to where it shows your objective is when you open the menu. For example if you don't have Tundra Express unlocked, it will take you to Three Horns because that's the closest fast travel you have unlocked. (Determined by the game not the mod)


Specific and Last Station are saved per save, per playthrough level like the game does.


To pick a specific station, set your hotkey and press that hotkey on the station you want in the fast travel menu. It will add a * next to your selected station. Selecting the already active station will remove the location.


Last station means if you travel from sanctuary to the dust, your dust fast travel will say return to sanctuary and send you there.
