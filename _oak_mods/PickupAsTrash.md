Adds a secondary interaction to pickups, to pickup and mark as trash, and adds a "Sell All Trash" secondary interaction to weapon vendors in BL3.

This is not a bindable mod key - it uses the game's "Secondary Use" bind, when looking at an item:

![Item cards with Pickup As Trash interaction]({{ "/assets/mods/oak/pickup_as_trash/PickupAsTrash.jpg" | relative_url }})
{:style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%"}

In BL3 the HUD prompt doesn't always show, because the HUD only shows max 2 prompts, but the interaction still works.

BL3 vendor interaction:

![Weapon vendor with Sell All Trash interaction]({{ "/assets/mods/oak/pickup_as_trash/PickupAsTrash_Vendor.jpg" | relative_url }})
{:style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%"}
