****WARNING: THIS MOD CAN HAVE LOTS OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND OFTEN IS VERY LOUD****
****RECOMMNDED YOU HAVE YOUR VOLUME LOW****

This mod will randomize projectiles all over your game. There's 2 types of things it randomizes. One is Firing Modes and the other is Projectiles.

Firing modes are mostly used on weapons. Guns and vehicles use them.

Projectiles are mostly used on grenades, however firing modes can have projectiles tied to them. 
You'll find most weapons with different projectiles than thier firing modes, the projectile will come out of the weapon.
Projectiles and Firing Modes will show on the item card.

Weapons also have a 50/50 chance of projectiles being changed or even added to their firing mode.

You'll see on the item card what each has been randomized to. 

Requirements:
HD Texture pack UNINSTALLED, your game will crash with the HD Pack on.

Suggested:
DXVK: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.4
Place d3d9.dll from the x32 folder in the same folder as bl2/tps exe

4gb patch: https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/
run it, and select your bl2/tps exe


Prepping the randomizer:
I HIGHLY recommend you use the prep projectile randomizer option in the main menu.
It will load multiple levels until it's found the set amount of firing modes and projectiles.

It only takes 2-3 minutes (depending on your PC) and you'll be set for your entire session.

If you find your game crashing while trying to use the randomizer prep, id recommend lowering projectiles first, then firing modes.

You can also use the 4gb patch on the exe, which may help a bit. 


Saving Items:
Items will get saved to a json file in 'saves' in the projectile randomizer. The save number will be the same as your character save number.

You can edit these saves by replacing the parts that you want.
Youll just have to find the barrel, Firing mode, and/or projectile you want to replace in the json.
