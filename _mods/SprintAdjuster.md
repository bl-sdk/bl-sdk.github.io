- Change speed when sprinting, while preserving normal speed when not sprinting.
- Optionally set Air Control to allow better control in the air with the movement keys, to have a better chance of stopping yourself from flinging off a cliff for instance.
- Configurable keybinding to allow turning on and off on the fly.
