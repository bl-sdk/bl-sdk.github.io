It's a concept we all know and love: Rare enemy variants, like Loot Midgets and Tubbies. Reign Of Giants extends this to every enemy in the game.

Yes, every enemy in the game! In Reign Of Giants, Psychos, Loaders, Saturn, Loot Midgets, Varkids, Savage Lee, Dexiduous the Invincible... All have a rare chance of spawning as a gigantic version of their normal self.

Upon encountering a Giant, you will be faced with an enemy notably stronger than the common variant, but will be appropriately rewarded. In addition to more XP, Giants drop a guaranteed item from a specialized loot pool.
